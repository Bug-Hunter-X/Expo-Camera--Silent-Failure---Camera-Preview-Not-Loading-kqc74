This error typically arises when you're using Expo's `Camera` API and the necessary permissions haven't been granted.  Specifically, the camera permission might be missing or denied by the user. This can manifest as a silent failure where the camera preview doesn't appear, or it might result in a more explicit error message indicating permission issues.  In this example, we'll show a common case where the camera preview doesn't load but there are no obvious error messages. The root cause is missing permission handling.
